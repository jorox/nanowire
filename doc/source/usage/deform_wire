in.deform_wire
===================

Purpose
========

To prepare nanowires for deformation after they have been cut out of a bulk sample.
This script will make sure that the nanowire has "forgotten" its old bulk state.
This means that the core and surface atoms have reorganized into their new positions.

Index variables
================

	* ``SKIP`` = differentiate between DUMP files
	* ``JUMP_SECTION`` = *MELT* or *COOL* or *RELAX* or *EQUIL* or *TEST* or *DONE*
	* ``DATA_TYPE`` = *RESTART* or *DATA*
	* ``DATA_FILE`` = File-name for input data
	* ``RADIUS_NW`` = Radius of nanowire for ``fix wall/region``
	* ``SEED`` = positive integer (default: 23154)
	* ``TEMP_RELAX`` = relaxation temperature in Kelvins (default: 300)
	* ``TEMP_HEAT``  = melting temperature in Kelvins (default: 4000)
	* ``MINIMIZE_CONFIG`` = minimize configuration
