A simple tutorial on how to cut out, prepare, and run a simulation deforming a silica nanowire.
	
Cutting out a wire from a bulk sample
======================================

To cut out a nanowire from a bulk sample you will need.

* A LAMMPS executable. It can be the simple serial version.
* *in.cut_wire* - the main script.
* *in.cut_recenter* - a helper script.
* A *DUMP* or *RESTART* [#f1]_ file which has the atomic coordinates of the bulk sample 

.. note::

	Make sure the bulk sample is large enough; at least twice the radius of the nanowire.


*in.cut_wire has several* :term:`CIV` to control the cutting procedure
* The cut axis
* The wire radius
* The wire length (top and lower boundaries)
* Reboxing the cut wire 

More information on the CIV of *in.cut_wire* can be found :doc:`here <cut_wire>`

Example,

To cut out a **R=30A**, **L=100A** wire from a 120A x 120A x 300A relaxed bulk sample along the **x-axis** and **rebox it** we issue

.. code-block:: bash

	LAMMPS -in in.cut_wire \
	-var DATA_FILE 9000/bulk_120_120_300_min.dat/ff_yeon/restart_files/bulk.7815.restart \
	-var WIRE_AXIS x -var WIRE_RADIUS 30 -var WIRE_CENTER -20 13 -var WIRE_LO -100 -var WIRE_HI 0 \
	-var DISTURB_ATOMS no -var REBOX_ATOMS yes \
	-var FOUT wire_30_100_1.dat -log log.1

This will produce a LAMMPS *DATA* file **wire_R_L_AXIS.dat** which contains atom coordinates of a nanowire with its axis along the z-axis.

Preparing a wire
====================

After cutting out a nanowire we must prepare it. Relax the surface and core atoms. We do this by melting at 4000K, and then cooling "slowly" to 300K, and we relax the structure under NPT and NVT conditions for several nanoseconds.

To do this edit preapre.slurm and change the following variables:

.. table :: 
	:widths: auto

	=================================  ==========================
 				Variable   						Meaning
	=================================  ==========================
	``PROJECT=wire_30_100_1.dat``       Project name
	``DATA_TYPE=DATA``                  Type of input-data file to LAMMPS
	``DATA_FILE=wire_30_100_1.dat``     The name of input-data file
	=============================================================


Example,

.. code-block:: bash

	./prepare.slurm wire_30_50_3.data DATA wire_30_50_3.data 0 MELT 30
	

Deforming a wire
====================

Once the NW is ready for deformation we use deform.slurm to perform the actual deformation

Example

.. code-block:: bash
 
	./deform.slurm


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] To read *RESTART* files you must use the same executable they were created with. Otherwise you must convert 

.. glossary::

	DATA
		A text file used by LAMMPS to input atom coordinates, velocities, ...

	RESTART
		A binary file created by LAMMPS to restart simulations

	CIV
		A control index variable. Index variables are used by LAMMPS for storing strings. In our case we use index variables to change options in the script file.
